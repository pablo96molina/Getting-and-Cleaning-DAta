Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
The included R script, Practice Getting and cleaning data.R, conducts the following:
Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.
Read both the train and test datasets and merge them into x(measurements), y(activity) and subject, respectively.
Modify column names to descriptive.
Extract data by selected columns(from step 3), and merge x, y(activity) and subject data. 
Generate 'Tidy Dataset' that consists of the average (mean) of each variable for each subject and each activity. The result is shown in the file Final2Result.txt.
